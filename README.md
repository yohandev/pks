## Overview
This is the public + internal website for MIT's Alpha Mu chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma(Skullhouse). It is a complete overhaul of any prior systems, authored in 2023 by Yohan Guyomard(yohang@mit.edu). Features include:
- Front-page with most relevant hyperlink(rush, summer housing, etc)
- Active brothers gallery
- Random house picture gallery
- Rush schedule
- Summer housing form(+ virtual tour)
- List of officers(+ contact form)
- House cleaning jobs/schedule*
- House waiting jobs/schedule*
- Party jobs/schedule*
- Menu for the week*
- House Google Drive*
- SMAPP form*
- Rush PNM list*

*visible only to logged-in brothers

## Updating the Website
The website automatically displays the data stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ii4pBOw8l2jdVzGyGnBEyjXS7iMiTF-h?usp=sharing). Otherwise... good luck. ðŸ«¡
Some tips for your journey:
- The website can be rebuilt(and published) on Athena using `yarn run build`
- This is technically a static site, and everything the user *should* see is either in the `www/` directory or stored in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ii4pBOw8l2jdVzGyGnBEyjXS7iMiTF-h?usp=sharing). There is no "server code"

## Mobile App
The website also comes with a mobile app for brothers. It sends push notifications for jobs and is otherwise more practical than the website. That being said, the app *is* the website, so any changes made there will be reflected without needing an update. If it does need to be updated, here are the instructions:


For Android: use the Chi gmail(phikaps.am.mit@gmail.com) to publish on Google Play.

For iOS: TODO(yohang).

## Technical Overview
- Frontend: `Preact`
- Backend: `Google Sheets`(yes, really)
